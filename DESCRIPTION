Description: Enables quick calibration of radiocarbon dates under various
    calibration curves (including user generated ones); Age-depth modelling as
    per the algorithm of Haslett and Parnell (2008); Relative sea level rate
    estimation incorporating time uncertainty in polynomial regression models; and
    non-parametric phase modelling via Gaussian mixtures as a means to determine
    the activity of a site (and as an alternative to the Oxcal function SUM). The
    package includes a vignette which can be accessed via the vignette.
